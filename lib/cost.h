/**
 * Interface defining the cost b/n two vertices.
 * Graph search algorithms often require two types of cost:
 *
 * * the best possible real cost that a path b/n two vertices can have
 *
 * * a heuristic cost that is an underestimate of that real cost but
 *     is useful during path searching.
 *
 * This interface defines the two types of costs. The heuristic function
 * is more important and subclasses of this interface are required to
 * provide it. The real function is used only for tie-breaking and
 * is not crucial but could change performance in certain cases.
