 *  A generic grid "path" represented by:
 * 1) a list of cells it passes through
 * 2) a generic data type that is application-specific
 * 3) the total cost (e.g. distance,time,etc...) of the path
 *
 * The cells containt generic data type CellData, while the grid path contains generic
 * data type PathData, which by default is a vector of CellData's.  PathData is useful for
 *representing
 * e.g. a continuous trajectory corresponding to the discrete sequence of cells.
